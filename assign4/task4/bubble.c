     long does not exceed the bounds imposed by the string's length. However, each 
	 string stored in array Strings must not waste space. That is, only the buffer
	 used by fgets() to temporary store the string read from input stream needs to 
	 be LEN bytes long.

     Your code must meet the following requirements:
        (i) The comparison of two strings must be done by checking them one
            character at a time, without using any C string library functions.
            That is, write your own while/for loop to do this.
       (ii) Implement a swap function to swap two strings by swapping pointers
	    without copying any chars.You are not allowed to use any C library 
	    functions in swap.
      (iii) You are allowed to use strlen() to calculate string lengths.
